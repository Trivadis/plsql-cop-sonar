# db* CODECOP for SonarQube

## Introduction

db* CODECOP for SonarQube is a plugin for [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/). The plugin analyses SQL and PL/SQL code and calculates various metrics and checks the code for compliance of the [Trivadis PL/SQL & SQL Coding Guidelines Version 3.6](https://trivadis.github.io/plsql-and-sql-coding-guidelines/v3.6/). Behind the scenes the plugin calls the [db* CODECOP command line](https://github.com/Trivadis/plsql-cop-cli) utility for the static code analysis.

A static code analysis is typically initiated as part of an continuous integration setup, e.g. at the end of a Jenkins or Hudson build job. SonarQube stores the result of the analysis in a relational database. Supported are HSQLDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database, of course.

Since every analysis is stored as a snapshot in the SonarQube repository the improvement or the decrease of the code quality may be monitored very well. Use SonarQube and the db* CODECOP plugin if you care about your PL/SQL code quality.

## Examples

Setup a build job with a standalone SonarQube analysis at the end of the job. Here’s an example within a Jenkins build job:

Important are the analysis properties. The mandatory ones are sonar.projectKey, sonar.projectName, sonar.projectVersion and sonar.sources. You may defined them as shown above or within a sonar.properties file in the source folder. See the [SonarQube documentation](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analysis+Parameters) for more information.

The build job is typically started after a change in the software configuration system such as GIT, SVN or CVS or other relevant events. You may even trigger the build manually. The log of such a build job looks as follows:

At the bottom of a build log you find a link to the SonarQube project dashboard. Click on it and the following project dashboard is shown:

There are a lot more analysis available in [SonarQube](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Installing+a+Plugin). Get your copy of [db* CODECOP](https://github.com/Trivadis/plsql-cop-cli/releases) and [db* CODECOP for SonarQube](https://github.com/Trivadis/plsql-cop-sonar/releases) now.

## Installation

Copy the downloaded sonar-plsql-cop-plugin-x.x.x.x.jar file into the extensions/plugins folder of your SonarQube installation and restart the [SonarQube](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Installing+a+Plugin) server. Login as admin, click on “Settings” in the main menu bar and configure the “Trivadis db* CODECOP” section as shown below

Press “Save Trivadis db* CODECOP Settings” to the configuration.

The path to the db* CODECOP command line utility and the license file must be valid for the machine doing the analysis with [SonarQube Scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner). If you are using Jenkins then db* CODECOP command line utility must be installed on every Jenkins node.
